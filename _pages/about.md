I am a postdoc in Barbara Engelhardt's group at Gladstone Institutes. Previously, I was a graduate student in the Computational and Systems Biology program at MIT with advisors Bonnie Berger and Alex Shalek. 

My research interests include computational biology applied to maternal and women's health.
