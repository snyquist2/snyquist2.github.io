I am a postdoc in Barbara Engelhardt's group at Gladstone Institutes. Previously, I was a graduate student in the csbphd.mit.edu/ program at MIT with advisors [Bonnie Berger](https://people.csail.mit.edu/bab/) and [Alex Shalek](https://shaleklab.com/). In graduate school, I worked with scRNA-seq data to study human health and disease. I was lucky to work with many collaborators all over the world to apply this technology to study TB, HIV, acute rhinosinusitus, [COVID-19](https://chemistry.mit.edu/chemistry-news/researchers-identify-cells-likely-targeted-by-covid-19-virus/), and lactation.

My current research interests include computational biology applied to [maternal and women's health](https://news.mit.edu/2021/sarah-nyquist-reproductive-health-0617). 

As an undergraduate, I studied computer science at Rice University and [completed my thesis](https://csprofiles.rice.edu/2016/04/28/snyquist/ ) under the direction of Erez Lieberman-Aiden. I contributed to the [DNA Zoo project](https://www.dnazoo.org/) and the Biotechniques Lab Grammy award-winning [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dES-ozV65u4 ) on the 3D genome.
